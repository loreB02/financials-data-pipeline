# 📊 Financials Data Pipeline
## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to **clean and transform raw financial data** through a complete **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** process, followed by an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**.  
The insights discovered during EDA were used to design an interactive **Power BI dashboard**, enabling a clear understanding of the company’s **sales performance, profitability, and overall financial health**.  
Throughout the project, I applied and deepened my knowledge of key **financial metrics** and **data analysis techniques** that helped me translate data into actionable insights.

## 🧩 Project Objectives

- **Clean and transform raw financial data** using **Python (Pandas)** to ensure data quality, consistency, and readiness for analysis.  
- **Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**, identifying trends, correlations, and outliers within the dataset.  
- **Leverage SQL (SQLite3)** within the Python environment to query and aggregate key financial information efficiently.  
- **Develop an interactive Power BI dashboard** that visualizes core financial metrics—such as sales, costs, and profitability—to support data-driven insights.

## 🧠 Dashboard Structure
The final Power BI report consists of three main pages:

1. **Overview** – General view of total sales, profit, and key financial indicators.  
2. **Sales** – Analysis of sales by category, region, and time period.  
3. **Profitability** – Evaluation of profit, COGS, and discount impact.
